	\frametitle{Conclusions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item State-of-the-art machine learning methods for miRNA prediction do not perform well on new species. \pause \vspace{16pt}
		\item Sequence alignment methods have a better performance, but only for low recall rates. \pause \vspace{16pt}
		\item Using convolutional neural networks, we can \textit{learn} which are the important characteristics that define
			a pre-miRNA. \pause \vspace{16pt}
		\item The proposed method achieves a precision many times higher at high recall rates in three tested species.
